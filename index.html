  <h1>MightyV Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 15 November 2025</p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the MightyV application ("Application") for Android devices,
    developed and published by SmartServe Labs ("Service Provider"). MightyV is an IPTV <strong>player</strong>
    only: you must supply your own IPTV playlists or provider credentials. The Application does not host or
    distribute any media content. MightyV is offered as a freemium service&mdash;core tools are free with ads,
    and a paid subscription removes ads. The service is provided "AS IS".
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>1.1 User-Provided Information</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>IPTV server URL, username, password, avatars, favorites, and other profile data entered in the Application. These credentials remain on your device and are used solely to connect to your IPTV provider; we do not host them.</li>
    <li>Contact details you share when requesting support.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We use this information to operate and maintain the Application, respond to support inquiries, send important notices, and deliver optional marketing communications permitted by law.</p>
  <p><strong>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device details (model, OS version, language, IP address, carrier, advertising ID).</li>
    <li>Usage analytics (screens viewed, crash logs) to monitor performance and fix issues.</li>
    <li>Ad interactions (impressions, clicks) via Google AdMob.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Location Data</h2>
  <p>We do not collect precise GPS location. Third-party services (Ads/Analytics) may infer approximate location (city/country) from IP addresses to comply with regulations.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Application integrates the following services, each governed by its own privacy policy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Play Services</li>
    <li>Google Play Billing</li>
    <li>Google User Messaging Platform (consent)</li>
    <li>Google AdMob</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may share aggregated, anonymized statistics with partners. Identifiable data is shared only to comply with legal obligations, protect rights or safety, or with contractors operating under duty of confidentiality.</p>

  <h2>4. Payments</h2>
  <p>All purchases/subscriptions (e.g., ad-free premium) are processed through Google Play Billing. We do not collect or store payment-card information; Google shares only subscription status.</p>

  <h2>5. Opt-Out & Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Uninstall the Application to stop all data collection.</li>
    <li>Use Android settings to reset advertising IDs, limit ad tracking, or withdraw consent through the Google User Messaging Platform.</li>
    <li>Cancel subscriptions via Google Play; ads resume when the subscription expires.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User-provided profile data stays on your device until you delete the app or clear its data.</li>
    <li>Aggregated analytics/crash logs may be retained for up to 24 months, then anonymized.</li>
    <li>To delete other data we hold (e.g., support requests), contact <a href="mailto:info@rdesigns.net">info@rdesigns.net</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children</h2>
  <p>MightyV is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from them. If you believe a child has provided information, contact us to remove it promptly.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards (encryption in transit, restricted access) to protect data, but no system is perfectly secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy periodically. Changes take effect once posted at this URL with an updated "Effective date." Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
