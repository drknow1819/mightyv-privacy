Privacy Policy
Effective date: 15 November 2025

This Privacy Policy applies to the MightyV application (“Application”) for Android devices, developed and published by SmartServe Labs (“Service Provider”). MightyV is an IPTV player only: you must provide your own IPTV playlists or provider credentials. The Application does not host or distribute any media content or streaming servers. MightyV is offered as a freemium service—core features remain free with ads, and you can subscribe to remove ads. The service is provided “AS IS”.

1. Information We Collect
1.1 User‑Provided Information

IPTV server URL, username, password, avatars, favorites, and other profile details you enter in the Application. These credentials stay on your device and are used solely to connect to your IPTV provider; we do not host them on our servers.
Contact details you provide when you email support.
We use this information to operate and maintain the Application, respond to support requests, send important notices (e.g., service changes, security alerts), and send optional marketing messages if permitted by law and your preferences.

1.2 Automatically Collected Information

Device information (model, OS version, language, IP address, carrier, advertising ID).
Usage analytics (screens visited, crash logs) to monitor performance and diagnose issues.
Ad interactions (impressions, clicks) via Google AdMob.
2. Location Data
We do not collect precise GPS location. Third-party partners (Ads/Analytics) may infer approx. location (city/country) from IP addresses to comply with regulations.

3. Third-Party Services
The Application uses the following services, each governed by its own privacy policies:

Google Play Services
Google Play Billing
Google User Messaging Platform (consent)
Google AdMob
We may share aggregated, anonymized statistics (e.g., number of active users) with partners. Individually identifiable data is shared only:

to comply with legal obligations,
to protect our rights or user safety,
with contractors operating under confidentiality agreements.
4. Payments
All purchases or subscriptions (e.g., ad-free premium) are processed through Google Play Billing. We do not receive or store payment-card information; Google shares only subscription status.

5. Opt-Out & Controls
Uninstall the Application to stop all data collection.
Use Android settings to reset advertising IDs, limit ad tracking, or withdraw consent via the Google User Messaging Platform.
Cancel your subscription anytime through Google Play; ads resume once the subscription expires.
6. Data Retention
User-provided profile data remains locally on your device until you delete the app or clear app data.
Aggregated analytics/crash logs may be retained for up to 24 months and then anonymized.
To request deletion of other data we hold (e.g., support emails), contact info@rdesigns.net.
7. Children
MightyV is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. If we learn that a child has provided data, we will delete it promptly. Parents/guardians may contact us to remove such data.

8. Security
We employ reasonable safeguards (encryption in transit, restricted access) to protect your information, but no system is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy periodically. Changes take effect once posted at the same URL, and the “Effective date” will reflect the latest revision. Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
